            <h1>Welcome to Ahmad's Page</h1>
            <p>Howdy! My name's Ahmad Raaiyan and I am currently a senior Computer Science student at Texas A&M, I also currently work as a Linux Infrastructure Admin for the Colleges of ArtSci and Engineering whenever I am not in class. Among my biggest interests in the broad field of Computer Science are Low Level Systems Programming and Artificial Intelligence/ML, and the different ways that the latter can be applied
                in our daily lives, oftentimes <a href="https://jaketae.github.io/study/auto-complete/">without us even knowing.</a> I believe this field has shown astronomical
                advancements ever since the conception of deep learning and it excites me to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11514">see the possiblities</a> that are explored and deployed every passing day. I hope you enjoy your stay!
