            <h1>Welcome to Ahmad's Page</h1>

            <p>Howdy! My name's Ahmad Raaiyan, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my digital space. As a senior Computer Science student at Texas A&M University, I'm on an exhilarating journey through the vast and ever-evolving landscape of technology. When I'm not immersed in my studies, you'll find me working as a Linux Infrastructure Administrator for the Colleges of Arts & Sciences and Engineering at Texas A&M, where I get to apply my passion for technology in real-world scenarios.
            </p>
            <p>I have always maintained a strong passion for the general space of computing, from the nitty gritty register level, all the way up to the most abstract tools and languages of today such as Python or JS/TS. However, my strongest passion has always been rooted in systems programming, having started my journey in programming with writing plain C code. I believe that proper memory management/process handling has become somewhat of a lost art, largely due to the absurd improvements we have made in the hardware realm as well as the costly abstractions we use today to develop software. I firmly believe that a programmer armed with the knowledge of what their complex runtimes/codebases are compiling down to and how all of it is running, will always write better code than those who operate on a “if I don’t see it, it doesn’t matter” ethos.
            </p>
            <p>As I approach the completion of my BS in Computer Science (expected Spring 2025), I'm excited about the future possibilities in tech and how I can best make my contribution in the space. Whether it's diving deeper into Linux management, expanding to managing cloud services, or diving into the world of systems programming and developing the most efficient software possible, I'm committed to continuous learning with a focus on innovation.
            </p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy exploring my work and ideas. Feel free to check out my projects on GitHub or connect with me to discuss anything from the latest in AI research to the intricacies of system administration. Welcome aboard this exciting journey through the world of technology!
            </p>
